Key patterns include:\n\n1. **Progressive Corrosion Issues**: Corrosion appears to be a persistent and worsening problem, particularly affecting structural integrity of the chassis near body mountings.\n\n2. **Declining Brake System Health**: The braking system shows deterioration over time with repeated issues of binding, corrosion, uneven application and disc wear.\n\n3. **Mileage Inconsistency**: The recorded mileage shows an unusual pattern, particularly between 2015-2016 tests where the mileage decreased from 47,720 to 46,700.\n\n4. **Frequent Electrical Failures**: Earlier MOTs show multiple electrical issues including inoperative hazard warning lamps and position lamps.\n\n## Summary Notes\n\nThis Ford Transit exhibits significant historical issues centered around chassis corrosion, brake system deterioration, and suspension component wear. The vehicle's MOT history demonstrates a pattern of structural corrosion that has required repeated attention. The braking system has shown consistent problems with binding, uneven application, and component wear. The suspension system has experienced corrosion in mounting areas and progressive wear in steering components. The frequency of similar failures across multiple test cycles suggests these are persistent issues rather than isolated incidents.
