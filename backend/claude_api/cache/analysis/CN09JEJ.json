Corrosion has progressively worsened over time, appearing initially on the exhaust system and later affecting the vehicle's structure and underside. While braking issues haven't caused MOT failures, there are recurring advisories about brake performance and component wear. Several manufacturer technical service bulletins align with the observed issues, suggesting some problems may be common to this model. The vehicle's mileage has increased steadily, with approximately 10,000 miles covered annually in recent years, reaching 127,930 miles at the most recent test.",
