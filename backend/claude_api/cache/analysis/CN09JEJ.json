The vehicle has a documented history of progressive corrosion affecting the underside and structure, which while not currently compromising structural rigidity, requires monitoring.\n\nOil leaks are present but not considered excessive in the latest MOT. These may be related to known issues documented in Honda's technical service bulletins regarding DPF regeneration problems and engine control module software faults that can affect oil levels.\n\nThe braking system has shown intermittent issues, with the latest MOT noting brake grabbing, which aligns with a known technical bulletin regarding brake pressure sensor issues.\n\nThe vehicle's mileage has increased steadily over the years, reaching 127,930 in the latest 2024 MOT, indicating regular use.",
